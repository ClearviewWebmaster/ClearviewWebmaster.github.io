			<p>Here at Vulcan Intelligence safety is our number one priority, so we’ve ensured that the AI can’t perform a HAL like malfunction. We have hardcoded safety nets and a wired power off switch in every room the AI can control. Not only that, but there are also hardcoded rules that the robot cannot break such as doing things without permission, harming living things, and destroying things. Monitoring software is included with the AI and robot bundles, so you can see what your robot is computing at any given time. </p><hr>

			<h3>RECREATION </h3><hr>
			<p>Our robots with our artificial intelligence have many recreational uses too. Human sports can be enhanced by having robotic training partners. Intelligent robots can perfectly analyze training and provide perfect coaching as well as never fatiguing, which allows them to help push athletes to their best ability. Children can even have robots play with them at the playground. Robots would keep the playground area supervised making sure the children are safe. These robots that play with children could have unique and childlike designs to make them appealing and entertaining to the kids. Even our pets could have small robotic buddies to keep them entertained.</p><hr>

			<h3 class="pad">COMMERCIAL</h3><hr>
			<p>The standard AI that has been created by Vulcan Intelligence will have the ability to aid most businesses. For retail stores, imagine never having to review a receipt and the product to figure out a refund when you can just have an AI with a simple code review it instead. Instead of a secretary you simply have our Z model answering and directing the calls. All paperwork will sort through our model at millions of times the pace of a human. With our H model, the physical body can help provide care with patients at hospitals if a nurse is occupied.</p><hr>

			<h3>EDUCATION</h3><hr>
			<p>Not only does our robot and AI have applications in the business world, but it also has valuable applications in the classroom. If a teacher can’t come into class they could give the lesson plan to the AI and have them teach it, with the substitute only acting as a chaperone for the students. Teachers can use the robot and AI to personally tutor students that wouldn’t get the attention they need due to time constraints. The robot and AI in combination have an infinite amount of ways to benefit the classroom, whether it be a quick calculator or to teach the entire class. </p><hr>

			<h3 class="pad">RESEARCH</h3><hr>
			<p> This robot could aid scientific research, such as grabbing a tool you might need or even mixing chemicals in a sealed room to avoid exposure to hazardous materials. This is perfect to minimize accidents when working with dangerous materials, and even enables researchers to experiment with more unknown materials without the danger of getting near the material. The research model is also useful for quick analysis of certain materials, such as fossils and other biological objects. The research body is able to quickly identify characteristics of these items that identify descriptions such as; the age of the item, in what ecosystem it was located, etc.</p><hr>
